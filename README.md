# <u>**The cursed meme fork eddition**</u> made by a stupid lefeon

Here's my playground of NTM modding: This mod does not focus on porting stuff from 1.7.10, but rather throw in bunch of exclusive contents to make some flavor.<br>
This mod aims on making frequent updates, <i>in exchange for less reliability and stability</i>. This is a local project not focused on production.<br>

# <u>Technical information</u>
If you'd like to build the mod and you're struggling on it, go read the README on [FireDragon91245's fork](https://github.com/FireDragon91245/NTM-Ext-Ext), since I have no idea how the build configurations work anymore ever since merging their fork lmao

Not my fault ^-^
