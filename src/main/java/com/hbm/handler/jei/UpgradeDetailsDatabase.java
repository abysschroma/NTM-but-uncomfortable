        EXAMPLES FOR MY MELTY BRAIN CELLS
        Formulas like speed = speed * (1 + speedLevel);
              or like speedMod = speedMod + speedLevel;     speed = speed * speedMod => "speed","+1x" "+2x" "+3x" etc
        Formulas like speedMod = speedMod * (1+speedLevel); speed = speed * speedMod => "speed","×2"  "×3"  "×4" etc
        Formulas like speed = speed + speedLevel;                                    => "speed","+1"  "+2"  "+3"  etc

        basically no x when it's absolute change
        P.S. ah forget it this is beyond the limits of an idiot called me

        CONVERTING EXAMPLE
        "speed","×2"  "×4"  "×6" => "+1x" "+3x" "+5x"

        yeah i have no idea how to make people understand those complicated formulas in like 3 characters long
